        <h3>SIMPLE CHOCOLATE CAKE</h3>
        <p> This recipe is a great recipe to make a simple choclate cake. 
            It uses ingredients that can be found in most kitchen cupboards. 
            You just need to gather all the ingredients, put them into a big bowl 
            and mix them with a blender or mixer! 
            It can also be used to make cupcakes too, if you adjust 
            the cooking times as mentioned below. 
            Then you can decorate your cake however you'd like to. </p>

        <h3>DECORATIONS</h3>
        <p> Once the cake or cupcakes have cooled, decorate them.
